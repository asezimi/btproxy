# Btproxy

This repository is forked and modified version from btproxy.

### Improvement
- Added half-inq option which enable you to run btproxy with undiscoverable master device
- Rewrite small amount of code to surpress deprecated warnings, and execute by python3

### Bug fix
- Fixed a issue in _mitm_sdp that prevented it from accepting new connections and getting stuck after both master and slave sockets were removed from fds.

If you installed BlueZ 4.X from source code, you may need to add `#define HCI_CHANNEL_USER 1` to the hci.h header to successfully setup btproxy.

### Tested Devices

* Pebble Steel smart watch
* Moto 360 smart watch
* OBDLink OBD-II Bluetooth Dongle
* Withings Smart Baby Monitor

If you have tried anything else, please let me know at conorpp (at) vt (dot) edu.  

### Dependencies

- Need at least 1 Bluetooth card (either USB or internal).
- Need to be running Linux or another *nix.
- BlueZ 4

For a debian system, run

```bash
sudo apt-get install bluez bluez-tools libbluetooth-dev python-dev
```

### Installation

```bash
sudo python setup.py install
```

### Running

To run a simple MiTM or proxy on two devices, run

```bash
btproxy <master-bt-mac-address> <slave-bt-mac-address>
```
   
Run `btproxy` to get a list of command arguments.

#### Example

```bash
# This will connect to the slave 40:14:33:66:CC:FF device and 
# wait for a connection from the master F1:64:F3:31:67:88 device
btproxy F1:64:F3:31:67:88 40:14:33:66:CC:FF
```

Where the master is typically the phone and the slave mac
address is typically the other peripherial device (smart watch, headphones, keyboard, obd2 dongle, etc).

The master is the device the sends the connection request and the slave is 
the device listening for something to connect to it.

After the proxy connects to the slave device and the master connects to the proxy device,
you will be able to see traffic and modify it.

#### How to find the BT MAC Address?  

Well, you can look it up in the settings usually for a phone.  The most
robost way is to put the device in advertising mode and scan for it.

There are two ways to scan for devices: scanning and inquiring.
hcitool can be used to do this:

```bash
hcitool scan
hcitool inq
```

To get a list of services on a device:

```bash
sdptool records <bt-address>
```

### Usage

Some devices may restrict connecting based on the name, class, or address of another bluetooth device.  
So the program will lookup those three properties of the target devices to be proxied,
and then clone them onto the proxying adapter(s).

Then it will first try connecting to the slave device from the
cloned master adaptor.  It will make a socket for each service
hosted by the slave and relay traffic for each one independently.

After the slave is connected, the cloned slave adaptor will be set
to be listening for a connection from the master.  At this point, the real master device
should connect to the adaptor.  After the master connects, the proxied connection
is complete.

#### Using only one adapter

This program uses either 1 or 2 Bluetooth adapters.  If you use one adapter, then only
the slave device will be cloned.  Both devices will be cloned if 2 adapters are used; this might
be necessary for more restrictive Bluetooth devices.


### Advanced Usage

Manipulation of the traffic can be handled via python 
by passing an inline script.  Just implement the master_cb and
slave_cb callback functions.  This are called upon receiving 
data and the returned data is sent back out to the corresponding device.

```python
# replace.py
def master_cb(req):
    """
        Received something from master, about to be sent to slave.
    """
    print '<< ', repr(req)
    open('mastermessages.log', 'a+b').write(req)
    return req

def slave_cb(res):
    """
        Same as above but it's from slave about to be sent to master
    """
    print '>> ', repr(res)
    open('slavemessages.log', 'a+b').write(res)
    return res
```


Also see the example functions for [manipulating Pebble watch traffic in replace.py](https://github.com/conorpp/btproxy/blob/master/libbtproxy/replace.py#L33)

This code can be edited and reloaded during runtime by entering 'r'
into the program console. This avoids the pains of reconnecting.  Any errors
will be caught and regular transmission will continue.

### TODO

- BLE
- Improve the file logging of the traffic and make it more interactive for
- replays/manipulation.
- Indicate which service is which in the output.
- Provide control for disconnecting/connecting services.
- PCAP file support
- ncurses?


### How it works

This program starts by killing the bluetoothd process, running it again with
a LD_PRELOAD pointed to a wrapper for the bind system call to block bluetoothd
from binding to L2CAP port 1 (SDP).  All SDP traffic goes over L2CAP port 1 so
this makes it easy to MiTM/forward between the two devices and we don't have to
worry about mimicking the advertising.

The program first scans each device for their name and device class to make
accurate clones.  It will append the string '_btproxy' to each name to make them
distinguishable from a user perspective.  Alternatively, you can specify the
names to use at the command line.

The program then scans the services of the slave device.  It makes a socket
connection to each service and open a listening port for the master device to 
connect to.  Once the master connects, the Proxy/MiTM is complete and output will be
sent to STDOUT.

### Notes

Some bluetooth devices have different methods of pairing which
makes this process more complicated.  Right now it supports SPP and legacy pin pairing.

This program doesn't yet have support for Bluetooth Low Energy.
A similiar approach to BLE can be taken.

### Errors

#### btproxy or bluetoothd hangs

If you are using bluez 5, you should try uninstalling and installing [bluez 4](http://www.bluez.org/download/).  I've had problems with 
bluez 5 hanging.

#### error accessing bluetooth device

Make sure the bluetooth adaptors are plugged in and enabled.

Run

```bash
    # See the list of all adaptors
    hciconfig -a

    # Enable
    sudo hciconfig hciX up

    # if you get this message
    Can't init device hci0: Operation not possible due to RF-kill (132)

    # Then try unblocking it with the rfkill command
    sudo rfkill unblock all
```

#### UserWarning: \<path\>/.python-eggs is writable by group/others

Fix

```bash
chmod g-rw,o-x <path>/.python-eggs
